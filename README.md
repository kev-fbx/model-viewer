# ModelViewer
___
## Introduction
ModelViewer is a dekstop application built using GLFW and OpenGL that allows users to open

## Installation
CMake is required to build the program. Download it [here](https://cmake.org/download/)
1. Run the `setup_windows.bat` file.
2. The batch file should open the `/Release` directory, which contains the executable application.
3. To open a 3D model file, there are 3 options (WIP):
   3.1. Drag and drop a 3D model file onto `ModelViewer.exe`, and the file will open in a new window automatically.
   3.2. Right click on a 3D model file and go to `Open with > Choose another app > ModelViewer.exe`
